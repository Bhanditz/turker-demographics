To extract data from raw database dump, do the following IN ORDER:

vi compile_data_from_raw.py 
set 'RAW_DIR' to be the root dir of the database files
set 'OUTPUT_DIR' to be the directory into which extracted data should be written
./compile_data_from_raw.py assignments
./compile_data_from_raw.py turkers

vi qc.py 
set 'RAW_DIR' to be the root dir of the database files
set 'OUTPUT_DIR' to be the directory into which extracted data should be written
./qc.py assignments
./qc.py turkers

**run assignments first. assignment data has to be extracted and saved in OUTPUT_DIR before turker data can be extracted**
