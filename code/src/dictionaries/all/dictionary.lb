entropie	entropy is a macroscopic property of a system that is a measure of the microscopic disorder within the system. it is an important part of the second law of thermodynamics. thermodynamic systems are made up of microscopic objects, e.g. atoms or molecules, which "carry" energy. according to the second law of thermodynamics, the thermodynamic entropy is a measure of the amount of energy which does no work during energy conversions. in applied thermodynamics, as a matter of convention, entropy is measured in units of energy per temperature (si: joules per kelvin). if thermodynamic systems are described using thermal energy instead of temperature, then entropy is just a number by which the thermal energy in the system is multiplied. the resulting energy is an energy for which no information is available which would be required to convert the energy in technical systems from one form (e.g. electrical) into another form (e.g. mechanical).,entropy,

renaissance	renaissance,the renaissance (french for "rebirth"; , from ri- "again" and nascere "be born") was a cultural movement that spanned roughly the 14th to the 17th century, beginning in florence in the late middle ages and later spreading to the rest of europe. the term is also used more loosely to refer to the historic era, but since the changes of the renaissance were not uniform across europe, this is a general use of the term. as a cultural movement, it encompassed a resurgence of learning based on classical sources, the development of linear perspective in painting, and gradual but widespread educational reform. traditionally, this intellectual transformation has resulted in the renaissance being viewed as a bridge between the middle ages and the modern era. although the renaissance saw revolutions in many intellectual pursuits, as well as social and political upheaval, it is perhaps best known for its artistic developments and the contributions of such polymaths as leonardo da vinci and michelangelo, who inspired the term "renaissance man".,rebirth,

pandora	in greek mythology, pandora (ancient greek, , derived from πᾶν "all" and δῶρον "gift", thus "giver of all", "all-endowed") was the first woman. as hesiod related it, each god helped create her by giving her unique gifts. zeus ordered hephaestus to mould her out of earth as part of the punishment of mankind for prometheus' theft of the secret of fire, and all the gods joined in offering her "seductive gifts". her other name, inscribed against her figure on a white-ground kylix in the british museum, is anesidora, "she who sends up gifts," up implying "from below" within the earth. according to the myth, pandora opened a jar (pithos), in modern accounts sometimes mistranslated as "pandora's box" (see below), releasing all the evils of mankind— although the particular evils, aside from plagues and diseases, are not specified in detail by hesiod — leaving only hope inside once she had closed it again. she opened the jar out of simple curiosity and not as a malicious act.,pandora,

collège	college,college (latin: collegium) is a term most often used today in ireland and the united states to denote a degree-awarding tertiary educational institution and in other english-speaking countries to refer to a secondary school in private educational systems. more broadly, it can refer to any group of colleagues, such as an electoral college, a college of arms or the college of cardinals. originally, it meant a group of persons living together, under a common set of rules (con- = "together" + leg- = "law" or lego = "i choose"); indeed, some colleges call their members "fellows". the precise usage of the term varies among the english-speaking countries. in the united states and ireland, for example, the terms "college" and "university" may be regarded as loosely interchangeable, whereas in the united kingdom, canada, australia and other commonwealth countries, a "college" is usually an institution between school and university level (although constituent schools within universities are sometimes known as "colleges"). in french, a "collège" refers both to 4 years of middle school and to a general concept of sharing an institution, and in the commonwealth countries, some older private primary and secondary schools retain this sense of the word (for example, eton college).,

nouveau	a nouveau, or vin (de) primeur, is a french wine which may, under the appellation d'origine contrôlée (aoc) regulations, be sold in the same year in which it was harvested. the most widely exported nouveau wine is beaujolais nouveau which is released on the third thursday of november, often only a few weeks after the grapes were harvested. nouveau wines are often light bodied and paler in color due to the very short (or nonexistent) maceration period followed by a similarly short fermentation. the wines will most likely not be exposed to any oak or extended aging prior to being released to the market. nouveau wines are characteristically fruity and may have some residual sugar. they are at their peak drinkability within the first year. as of 2005, there were 55 aocs in france permitted to make nouveau wines.,new,

herakles	heracles, born alcaeus (Ἀλκαῖος, alkaios) or alcides (Αλκείδης, alkeidēs), was a divine hero in greek mythology, the son of zeus (Ζεύς) and alcmene, foster son of amphitryon and great-grandson (and half-brother) of perseus. he was the greatest of the greek heroes, a paragon of masculinity, the ancestor of royal clans who claimed to be heracleidae (Ἡρακλεῖδαι) and a champion of the olympian order against chthonic monsters. in rome and the modern west, he is known as hercules, with whom the later roman emperors, in particular commodus and maximian, often identified themselves. the romans adopted the greek version of his life and works essentially unchanged, but added anecdotal detail of their own, some of it linking the hero with the geography of the central mediterranean. details of his cult were adapted to rome as well.,heracles,

revue	review,a revue is a type of multi-act popular theatrical entertainment that combines music, dance and sketches. the revue has its roots in 19th century american popular entertainment and melodrama but grew into a substantial cultural presence of its own during its golden years from 1916 to 1932. though most famous for their visual spectacle, revues frequently satirized contemporary figures, news or literature. due to high ticket prices, ribald publicity campaigns and the occasional use of prurient material, the revue was typically patronized by audience members who earned more and felt less restricted by middle-class social mores than their contemporaries in vaudeville. like much of that era's popular entertainments, revues often featured material based on sophisticated, irreverent dissections of topical matter, public personae and fads, though the primary attraction was found in the frank display of the female body.,

kelvin	kelvin,the kelvin (symbol: k) is a unit increment of temperature and is one of the seven si base units. the kelvin scale is a thermodynamic (absolute) temperature scale referenced to absolute zero, the absence of all thermal energy. so by definition, the temperature of a substance at absolute zero is zero kelvin (0 k). the secondary reference point on the kelvin scale is the triple point of water (0.01 degrees celsius). the kelvin scale is the difference between these two reference points, with the kelvin defined as one 273.16th of this scale. the kelvin scale and the kelvin are named after the belfast-born physicist and engineer william thomson, 1st baron kelvin (1824–1907), who wrote of the need for an "absolute thermometric scale". unlike the degree fahrenheit and degree celsius, the kelvin is not referred to as a "degree", nor is it typeset with a degree symbol; that is, it is written k and not °k. the kelvin and the degree celsius are often used together, as they have the same interval, and 0 kelvin is -273.15 degrees celsius.,
