Dictionaries:

A. Translations checked using external dictionaries (David Y's old set of OCR'd dictionaries):
dictionaries/anni/externalOverlap
Final column indiates whether translation pair has been observed in external dictionaries or not. See dictionaries/anni/externalOverlap/README for more details

B. Translation pairs scored using monolingual signals, and a classifier trained on 'control' translation pairs:
dictionaries/anni/monoScored
Final column gives score: more positive indicates more likely to be a translation pair, more negative indicates less likely to be a translation pair. Control pairs scored using 10-fold cross validation. See dictionaries/anni/monoScored/README  for more details
