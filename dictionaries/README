Dictionaries:

A. Translations checked using external dictionaries (David Y's old set of OCR'd dictionaries):
dictionaries/anni/externalOverlap
Final column indiates whether translation pair has been observed in external dictionaries or not. See dictionaries/anni/externalOverlap/README for more details

B. Translation pairs scored using monolingual signals, and a classifier trained on 'control' translation pairs:
dictionaries/anni/monoScored
Final column gives score: more positive indicates more likely to be a translation pair, more negative indicates less likely to be a translation pair. Control pairs scored using 10-fold cross validation. See dictionaries/anni/monoScored/README  for more details

C. All translation pairs received from Mturk (approved assignments)
dictionaries/ellie/all

D. Translation pairs received from Mturk (approved assignments) for which the assignment was submitted from a location deemed 'in region' for the language being translated
dictionaries/ellie/clpair

E. Translation pairs received from Mturk (approved assignments) for which the assignment was submitted from a location deemed 'out of region' for the language being translated
dictionaries/ellie/nonclpair

F. Control pairs mined from wikipedia with known translations. 
dictionaries/ellie/controls/wiki

G. Control pairs mined from wikipedia with known translations. Dictionary contains known true translation and alternative translations received from Mturk, which were judged as valid synonyms in second pass HIT
dictionaries/ellie/controls/turkers/pos

H. Control pairs mined from wikipedia with known translations. Dictionary contains alternative translations received from Mturk, which were judged to be incorrect translations in second pass HIT
dictionaries/ellie/controls/turkers/neg
