Each dictionary contains 7 tab separated columns:

1. source language word
2. target language word
3. 0/1 indicator: 0=not a control source word, 1=a control source word
4. 0/1 indicator: 0=target word not known to be correct, 1=target word known to be correct (only control words have known translations; will never see 0-1 in columns 3-4)
5. 0/1 indicator: 0=not observed in mturk data; 1=observed in mturk data (some correct control translations not observed)
6. 0/1 indicator: 1=src/trg pair appears in external dictionary; 0=src/trg pair does not appear in external dictionary
7. 0/1 indicator: 1=src appears in external dictionary; 0=src does not appear in external dictionary
